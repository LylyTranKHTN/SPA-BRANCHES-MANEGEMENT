# SPA-BRANCHES-MANEGEMENT
The Spa management
The school project contains the source code for the front end using VueJS and the back end using .NET and Java. It is a management tool for the beauty clinic to manage their booking systems and a tool for customers to make reservations.

In this project, I was the leader of a team of 10-people size in the Backend using the .NET system. I applied MVP architecture, Dependency Injection design pattern with Inversion of Control pattern.
